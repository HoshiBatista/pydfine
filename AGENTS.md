# AGENTS.md — build guide for coding agents

This is the canonical instruction file for any AI agent (Claude Code, etc.) working
in this repo. Read it fully before writing code. `CLAUDE.md` defers to this file.

---

## 1. Mission

Build a `pip install`-able Python library that wraps **D-FINE**
(github.com/Peterande/D-FINE) with an **ultralytics-style** API, where the whole
model and training recipe is configured through **typed Python parameters on one
class (`DFINE`)** — **no YAML files, no config-registry indirection**.

A developer should be able to:

```python
from dfine import DFINE
model = DFINE(size="l", num_classes=80)      # or fully custom kwargs
model.predict(...); model.train(...); model.val(...); model.export(...)
```

## 2. Non-negotiable design principles

1. **Config-as-Python.** All model/training options are fields on a frozen
   `DFINEConfig` dataclass, surfaced as `DFINE(...)` constructor kwargs. Never
   require the user to read or write a `.yml`. (A `DFINEConfig.from_yaml()` /
   `.to_yaml()` interop helper is allowed, but must never be on the critical path.)
2. **No registry / DI magic.** Upstream builds modules via a custom
   `register`/`create` + `YAMLConfig` system in `src/core`. We **delete that layer**
   and instantiate every `nn.Module` directly from dataclass fields.
3. **Presets, not lock-in.** `size="n|s|m|l|x"` fills the per-variant defaults
   (see `docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`), but **every** field remains overridable inline.
4. **Weight-compatible.** A model built from a preset must load upstream pretrained
   `.pth` checkpoints and reproduce their reported COCO AP. Porting must preserve
   layer names/shapes (or provide a documented remap). This is the correctness bar.
5. **Ultralytics-shaped ergonomics.** `predict/train/val/export`, a `Results`
   object with `.boxes.xyxy/.conf/.cls`, `.plot()/.save()`, auto weight download.
6. **Typed and documented.** Full type hints; every public param has a docstring
   line and appears in `docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.
7. **Small, testable units.** Each ported module gets a shape/parity test.

## 3. Two build paths — pick one per module, prefer B unless noted

- **Path A — Port upstream `src/` into pure Python.** Copy the `nn.Module`s
  (HGNetv2, HybridEncoder, DFINETransformer, matcher, criterion, postprocessor),
  strip the registry decorators, and wire them from `DFINEConfig`. Maximum control,
  exact weight parity with upstream `.pth`.
- **Path B — Build on `transformers` `DFineModel`/`DFineConfig`.** HuggingFace already
  ported D-FINE YAML-free (`DFineConfig` is literally the flat param class we want,
  and pretrained weights load by name). Wrapping it gives us the model internals for
  free; we own only the ergonomics layer (config presets, predict/train/val/export,
  Results, augmentation, downloads).

**Default recommendation:** start with **Path B** to get an end-to-end working
`predict`/`train` fast, using `transformers`' `DFineConfig` field list as the
authoritative parameter set. Keep an adapter boundary (`dfine/backends/`) so Path A
(our own port) can be dropped in later without changing the public `DFINE` API.
`docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` lists params for both so the surface is identical.

Whichever path: the **public API and parameter names must not depend on the backend.**

## 4. Repository layout (target)

```
dfine/
  __init__.py          # exports DFINE, DFINEConfig, Results, Boxes
  config.py            # DFINEConfig dataclass + SIZE_PRESETS + validation
  model.py             # DFINE: the one user-facing class (predict/train/val/export)
  results.py           # Results / Boxes (exists in scaffold)
  registry.py          # preset name -> checkpoint URL (exists in scaffold)
  downloads.py         # weight cache/download (exists in scaffold)
  data.py              # input loading + COCO names (exists in scaffold)

    __init__.py        # get_backend(config) -> Backend
    transformers.py    # Path B backend

  cli.py               # `dfine predict|train|val|export|models` (exists in scaffold)
docs/                  # ARCHITECTURE.md, CONFIG_REFERENCE.md, ROADMAP.md
tests/                 # parity + unit tests
```

## 5. Architecture in one paragraph

D-FINE = HGNetV2 backbone → HybridEncoder (AIFI + CCFM/GELAN fusion) → DFINETransformer
decoder. The decoder's novelty is **FDR**: box regression is a distribution over
`reg_max` bins per edge, refined residually across decoder layers with a non-uniform
weighting function (`reg_scale`, `up`/`down` bounds). **GO-LSD** distills the final
layer's distribution into earlier layers (DDF loss). See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for
the full data flow and the module→param map.

## 6. Conventions

- Python ≥3.9, `torch`/`torchvision`. Type hints everywhere. `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Formatting: `ruff format` + `ruff check`. Line length 100.
- Docstrings: short one-liner per public function/param (Google-ish).
- No global state; device is explicit. No prints in library code — use `logging`.
- Public names are stable contracts; don't rename params casually.
- Keep functions small; a reviewer should grasp each in <30s.
- Every new module ships with a test in `tests/`.

## 7. How to work (loop)

1. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md`, pick the **lowest unchecked task in the current phase**.
2. Read the relevant section of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.
3. If porting from upstream, fetch the exact upstream module and match shapes/names.
4. Write the code + a test. Run tests. Iterate until green.
5. Update `docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` if you added/changed a param.
6. Check the box in `docs/ROADMAP.md` and note anything surprising.
7. Keep diffs focused — one task per change set.

## 8. Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"        # editable install with dev extras
ruff format . && ruff check .  # format + lint
pytest -q                      # run tests
pytest -q -k parity            # weight/output parity tests only
dfine models                   # sanity: list presets
```

## 9. Definition of Done (per task)

- [ ] Code typed, formatted, lint-clean.
- [ ] Test added and passing (shape/parity/behavior as appropriate).
- [ ] No YAML on the user's critical path; no registry/`create()` calls.
- [ ] Public param names match `docs/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.
- [ ] For model modules: loads matching upstream weights OR has a documented remap.
- [ ] Roadmap checkbox ticked.

## 10. Guardrails (do NOT)

- Do **not** reintroduce YAML configs or the upstream registry into the public path.
- Do **not** change public parameter names/semantics to match an internal backend;
  adapt the backend instead.
- Do **not** fabricate default values — verify against upstream `src/` or
  `transformers` `DFineConfig`. If unsure, mark `# TODO(verify)` and open a roadmap note.
- Do **not** vendor code without keeping its Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` + attribution.
- Do **not** hard-code paths, secrets, or a specific CUDA device.
